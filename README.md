# dmesg-continuous-logger
This repository contains a simple bash script, capture_dmesg.sh, designed to continuously capture dmesg logs to a file for as long as the script runs. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting and monitoring system-level messages, especially during periods of active testing or when trying to capture intermittent issues.
